# N-Body Simulation with KD-Tree Optimization Results

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Memory Management
- **Object Pool for KD-Tree**: Implemented a thread-safe pool for reusing KD-tree node slices between simulation steps, significantly reducing memory allocations and GC pressure.
- **Pre-allocation**: Pre-allocated all required memory before simulation begins, avoiding allocations during the simulation loop.
- **Memory Layout**: Improved memory layout for better cache coherency, particularly in particle data access patterns.

### 2. Algorithm Improvements
- **QuickSelect Algorithm**: Replaced the original partitioning algorithm with the more efficient QuickSelect algorithm for finding medians, reducing the tree building complexity from O(n logÂ² n) to O(n log n) on average.
- **Improved Barnes-Hut Implementation**: Optimized the distance calculations and criterion checking in the Barnes-Hut approximation algorithm.
- **Iterative Force Calculation**: Replaced recursion with an iterative approach using an explicit stack, eliminating function call overhead and potential stack overflows for deep trees.

### 3. Parallel Processing
- **Load Balancing**: Implemented better workload distribution among threads with a ceiling division approach.
- **Thread Management**: Used sync.WaitGroup for more explicit control over parallel workloads.
- **Reduced Contention**: Minimized thread synchronization points to reduce contention.
- **Adaptive Thread Count**: Automatically adapts to the available CPU cores if thread count is not specified.

### 4. Computational Efficiency
- **Single-Pass Calculations**: Combined calculations into single loops where possible, such as merging min/max calculations with center of mass computations.
- **Cheaper Math Operations**: Used conditional statements instead of math.Min/math.Max for better performance.
- **Reduced Memory Copies**: Accessed particle data by reference where possible to avoid copying.
- **Optimized Division**: Pre-calculated inverse mass (1/m) to replace division with multiplication.

## Performance Verification

The code includes comprehensive benchmarking to verify optimization effectiveness:

1. **Tree Construction**: Benchmarks tree building with different particle counts
2. **Force Calculation**: Measures force calculation performance across different particle counts
3. **Complete Step**: Tests full simulation steps with various thread counts and particle counts

## Energy Conservation

To verify solution accuracy, total system energy (kinetic + potential) is calculated:
- Before simulation begins
- After simulation completes
- The relative error is reported to confirm energy conservation

## Expected Improvements

Based on the optimizations implemented, we expect:

1. **Memory Efficiency**: Significantly reduced memory allocation and GC overhead
2. **Computational Speed**: 2-5x faster tree building and force calculations
3. **Scalability**: Better scaling with increasing particle counts and thread counts
4. **Accuracy**: Maintained simulation accuracy with minimal energy drift

## Usage Instructions

To run the optimized simulation:
```
go build -o kdtree-sim *.go
./kdtree-sim [steps] [particles] [threads]
```

To run benchmarks:
```
go test -bench=. -benchtime=10s
```

The simulation now outputs performance metrics in particles-steps/second, which allows for direct comparison with the original implementation.
