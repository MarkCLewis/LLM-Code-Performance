# Optimization Plan for KD-Tree N-Body Simulation

## Performance Analysis Approach
1. Profile the code to identify bottlenecks
   - Use Go's built-in profiler: `go test -bench=. -benchmem -cpuprofile=cpu.prof`
   - Analyze hot spots with `go tool pprof`

## Potential Optimization Areas

### 1. KD-Tree Construction
- **Current issue**: Tree is rebuilt from scratch every simulation step
- **Optimizations**:
  - Implement incremental tree updates when particles haven't moved far
  - Pre-allocate tree nodes to reduce allocations during simulation
  - Optimize the partitioning algorithm during tree building
  - Consider more efficient splitting strategies than median-based

### 2. Memory Management
- **Current issue**: Potential excessive allocations and garbage collection
- **Optimizations**:
  - Pool and reuse KD-tree node slices between steps
  - Pre-allocate the acceleration arrays
  - Switch from array of structs to struct of arrays for better memory locality
  - Consider unsafe.Pointer or CGO for critical sections

### 3. Parallel Execution
- **Current issue**: May not be optimally utilizing parallelism
- **Optimizations**:
  - Fine-tune the parallelism level based on workload and number of CPU cores
  - Implement work-stealing for better load balancing
  - Optimize the particle distribution to minimize thread contention
  - Consider SIMD instructions for vector operations (via assembly or CGO)

### 4. Algorithm Improvements
- **Current issue**: Barnes-Hut approximation settings may not be optimal
- **Optimizations**:
  - Tune THETA parameter (currently 0.3) for precision vs. speed tradeoff
  - Implement multipole expansions for more accurate approximations
  - Use approximate square root calculations where precision is less critical
  - Optimize the recursion in force calculations (consider iterative approach)

### 5. Data Structures
- **Current issue**: Fixed-size arrays in KDTree structure may be inefficient
- **Optimizations**:
  - Replace fixed-size particle arrays in leaf nodes with slices
  - Optimize data layout for cache coherency
  - Use more efficient data structures for nearest neighbor searches

### 6. Reduce Computational Redundancy
- **Current issue**: Some calculations may be redundant
- **Optimizations**:
  - Cache force calculations between nearby timesteps
  - Implement symmetry in force calculations (Newton's third law)
  - Use spatial hashing for close particle interactions

### 7. Go-Specific Optimizations
- **Current issue**: May not be utilizing Go's performance features
- **Optimizations**:
  - Use compiler directives to hint inlining
  - Reduce interface allocations
  - Minimize memory copying in hot paths
  - Consider using channels strategically for work distribution

## Implementation Priority
1. Profile the code to identify actual bottlenecks
2. Implement tree reuse between simulation steps
3. Optimize memory allocations and management
4. Improve parallelization strategy
5. Fine-tune algorithm parameters
6. Implement advanced algorithm optimizations

## Success Metrics
- Measure performance with large particle counts (100K, 1M)
- Compare execution time before and after optimizations
- Verify simulation accuracy is maintained
- Test scaling across different thread counts
