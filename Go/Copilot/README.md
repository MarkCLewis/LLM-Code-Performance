Can you optimize this furture?
------------------------------
Copilot automatically generated the optimized code.

Are there any flags you would add to the compiler or runtime for better
performance?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, there are several compiler and runtime flags you can use to optimize the performance of your Go code. Here are some recommendations:

Compiler Flags
Optimization Levels:

-gcflags="-N -l": Disables optimizations and inlining, useful for debugging but not for performance. For performance, you generally want optimizations enabled, which is the default behavior.
Architecture-Specific Tuning:

-ldflags="-s -w": Strips debug information and reduces binary size, which can improve performance.
Link-Time Optimization (LTO):

Go does not support LTO directly, but you can use -buildmode=pie to create position-independent executables which can sometimes improve performance.
Runtime Flags
Garbage Collection:

GOGC: Adjusts the garbage collection target percentage. Setting GOGC=off disables garbage collection, which can improve performance for short-lived programs but is generally not recommended for long-running applications.
Thread Affinity:

GOMAXPROCS: Sets the maximum number of CPUs that can be executing simultaneously. By default, it is set to the number of CPUs available, but you can adjust it for specific performance tuning.
Example Compilation Command
Combining these flags, your compilation command might look like this:

These flags and settings should help you achieve better performance for your N-body simulation. Let me know if you need further assistance!
