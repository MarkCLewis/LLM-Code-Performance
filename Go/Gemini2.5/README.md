### Runtime Optimization

Yes, there are a few compiler flags and runtime environment variables you could consider experimenting with, although Go's defaults are generally quite good, and significant gains usually come from algorithmic/code-level optimizations like you've already done (k-D tree, node pooling).

Here are the most relevant ones, categorized:

1. Profile Guided Optimization (PGO) - Often Most Effective

How it works: You first run your simulation and collect a CPU profile (e.g., using go test -bench=. -cpuprofile cpu.pprof or integrating runtime/pprof into your main function). Then, you build your application using that profile. The compiler uses the hotspot information from the profile to make more informed decisions about inlining, register allocation, code layout, etc.   
Flag: go build -pgo=path/to/profile.pprof   
Recommendation: Highly recommended. This is often the most impactful compiler optimization beyond the defaults for real-world workloads. It requires the extra step of collecting a representative profile first.
2. Microarchitecture Level (GOAMD64) - Potential FP Boost

How it works: This environment variable (set before building) tells the compiler the minimum required instruction set level for the target AMD64 (x86-64) CPU. Higher levels allow the compiler to use more modern, potentially faster instructions (like AVX, AVX2) for floating-point math, vectorization, etc., if it finds opportunities to do so.   
Environment Variable (set before go build):
export GOAMD64=v1 (Default - Compatible with nearly all 64-bit x86)
export GOAMD64=v2 (Requires SSE3, SSE4.1, SSE4.2, POPCNT - Most CPUs from ~2008 onwards)
export GOAMD64=v3 (Requires AVX, AVX2, BMI1, BMI2, FMA - Most CPUs from ~2013 onwards, e.g., Haswell/Excavator)
export GOAMD64=v4 (Requires AVX512F, AVX512BW, etc. - Newer server/HEDT CPUs)   
Recommendation: Worth trying if your target hardware supports it. Check your CPU specs. Building with GOAMD64=v3 (if supported) is often a good bet for floating-point heavy code like this N-body simulation. Benchmark to see if it provides a speedup on your specific hardware. If you distribute the binary, users need CPUs supporting that level.
3. Garbage Collection Tuning (GOGC) - Runtime Tuning

How it works: This environment variable controls the GC pacing. GOGC=100 (the default) triggers GC when the heap size doubles. Lower values (e.g., GOGC=50) trigger GC more often, potentially reducing max pause time but increasing total GC CPU usage. Higher values (e.g., GOGC=200) trigger GC less often, reducing total GC CPU usage but potentially increasing pause times and peak memory usage.   
Environment Variable (set before running): export GOGC=N (e.g., export GOGC=150)
Recommendation: Maybe experiment, but less likely to be crucial now. Since you implemented node pooling, allocation pressure during the main simulation loop should be significantly reduced. The default GOGC=100 might be perfectly fine. If you still observe GC activity impacting performance (use GODEBUG=gctrace=1 for diagnostics, but not during performance runs), you could try slightly increasing GOGC (e.g., 120-200) if you have sufficient memory.
4. Linker Flags for Stripping (-s -w) - Minimal Impact

How it works: These flags, passed via -ldflags, remove debugging information and symbol tables from the final executable.
Flag: go build -ldflags="-s -w"
Recommendation: Generally not for computational performance. This primarily reduces binary size and might slightly speed up process startup. It has negligible effect on the speed of the actual simulation calculations once running. It also makes debugging impossible. Use mainly for creating final distribution binaries if size is a concern.
Flags/Settings Generally NOT Recommended for Performance:

-gcflags="-N -l": Disables compiler optimizations and inlining. Only use for debugging the compiler or specific code generation issues. Hurts performance.   
-gcflags="-B": Disables bounds checking for slice/array accesses. Unsafe. Can lead to crashes or memory corruption if the compiler cannot prove safety (which it often can). Only consider if profiling strongly indicates bounds checks are a major bottleneck, and you are absolutely certain your indexing is correct.
-race": Enables the race detector. Incurs significant performance overhead. Only for debugging concurrency issues.
GODEBUG=asyncpreemptoff=1: Disables a newer form of goroutine preemption. Might slightly help extremely tight loops with no other preemption points, but can harm overall responsiveness and fairness. Not generally recommended.   
In Summary:

Definitely try PGO: go build -pgo=profile.pprof (after getting a profile).
Definitely try GOAMD64: Set export GOAMD64=v3 (or v4) before go build if your CPU supports it and benchmark the result.
Maybe experiment with GOGC: Run with export GOGC=150 or similar if profiling/gctrace suggests GC is still a factor despite pooling.
Use -ldflags="-s -w" only for final binary size reduction, not compute speed.
Always benchmark carefully on your target hardware after applying any changes to confirm whether they actually improve performance for your specific workload.
