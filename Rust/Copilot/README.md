Can you optimize this furture?
------------------------------
Copilot produced optimized code.


Are there any flags you would add to the compiler or runtime for better
performance?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, there are several compiler and runtime flags you can use to optimize the performance of your Rust code. Here are some recommendations:

Compiler Flags
Optimization Levels:

-C opt-level=3: Enables aggressive optimizations, including inlining and loop unrolling.
-C opt-level=z: Optimizes for binary size, which can sometimes improve performance by reducing cache misses.
Architecture-Specific Tuning:

-C target-cpu=native: Generates code optimized for your CPU architecture, utilizing advanced instructions like SSE and AVX.
Link-Time Optimization (LTO):

-C lto: Enables link-time optimization, which can improve performance by optimizing across translation units.
Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO):

-C profile-generate and -C profile-use: Collects runtime profile data and uses it to optimize the code.
Runtime Flags
Garbage Collection:

Rust does not use garbage collection, so this is not applicable.
Thread Affinity:

RAYON_NUM_THREADS: Sets the number of threads Rayon will use. By default, it is set to the number of logical CPUs available, but you can adjust it for specific performance tuning.
Example Compilation Command
Combining these flags, your compilation command might look like this:
