Can you optimize this furture?
------------------------------
Copilot produced the optimized code.


Are there any flags you would add to the compiler or runtime for better
performance?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, there are several compiler and runtime flags you can use to optimize the performance of your Java code. Here are some recommendations:

Compiler Flags
Optimization Levels:

-O: Enables basic optimizations.
-O2: Enables more aggressive optimizations.
-O3: Enables the most aggressive optimizations, including inlining and loop unrolling.
-Ofast: Enables aggressive optimizations, including -ffast-math, which can improve performance but may reduce numerical precision.
Architecture-Specific Tuning:

-march=native: Generates code optimized for the architecture of the machine you're compiling on, utilizing advanced instructions like SSE and AVX.
Link-Time Optimization (LTO):

-flto: Enables link-time optimization, which can improve performance by optimizing across translation units.
Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO):

-fprofile-generate and -fprofile-use: Collects runtime profile data and uses it to optimize the code.
OpenMP:

-fopenmp: Enables OpenMP support for parallel programming.
Runtime Flags
Garbage Collection:

-XX:+UseG1GC: Use the G1 garbage collector, which can improve performance for applications with large heaps.
-XX:+UseParallelGC: Use the parallel garbage collector for better performance on multi-core systems.
Thread Affinity:

-XX:ParallelGCThreads=<number>: Sets the number of garbage collection threads.
-XX:ConcGCThreads=<number>: Sets the number of concurrent garbage collection threads.
Memory Allocation:

-Xms<size>: Sets the initial heap size.
-Xmx<size>: Sets the maximum heap size.
Example Compilation Command
Combining these flags, your compilation command might look like this:
