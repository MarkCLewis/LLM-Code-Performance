Can you optimize this furture?
------------------------------
Copilot implemented the optimized code.


Are there any flags you would add to the compiler or runtime for better
performance?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, there are several compiler and runtime flags you can use to optimize the performance of your Julia code. Here are some recommendations:

Compiler Flags
Optimization Levels:

-O3: Enables aggressive optimizations, including inlining and loop unrolling.
-Ofast: Similar to -O3 but also includes -ffast-math, which can improve performance but may reduce numerical precision.
Architecture-Specific Tuning:

-march=native: Generates code optimized for your CPU architecture, utilizing advanced instructions like SSE and AVX.
Link-Time Optimization (LTO):

-flto: Enables link-time optimization, which can improve performance by optimizing across translation units.
Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO):

-fprofile-generate and -fprofile-use: Collects runtime profile data and uses it to optimize the code.
Runtime Flags
Garbage Collection:

GOGC: Adjusts the garbage collection target percentage. Setting GOGC=off disables garbage collection, which can improve performance for short-lived programs but is generally not recommended for long-running applications.
Thread Affinity:

GOMAXPROCS: Sets the maximum number of CPUs that can be executing simultaneously. By default, it is set to the number of CPUs available, but you can adjust it for specific performance tuning.
Example Compilation Command
Combining these flags, your compilation command might look like this:
