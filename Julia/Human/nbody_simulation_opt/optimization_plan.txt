# Optimization Plan for N-body Simulation with KD-Tree

## Current Performance Analysis

Examining the benchmark data shows:

1. The simulation scales with increasing thread count, but with diminishing returns beyond 12-24 threads
2. For 1,000,000 particles, even with 48 threads, each simulation step takes ~67 minutes
3. There's a significant amount of system time, indicating potential memory allocation or GC pressure
4. There are stack traces showing interrupts during execution, suggesting potential stability issues

## Optimization Targets

### 1. Memory Management and Allocation

- Replace unnecessary array allocations with in-place operations
- Pre-allocate vectors and reuse them across steps
- Use StaticArrays for small fixed-size vectors (positions, velocities)
- Implement memory pooling for KD-tree nodes

### 2. Algorithm Improvements

- Implement Barnes-Hut algorithm optimizations
- Use a better tree building algorithm with improved median selection
- Optimize the recursive accel_recur function to avoid deep stack traces
- Implement tail recursion or iterative alternatives for accel_recur

### 3. Parallelization Enhancements

- Optimize work distribution for Threads.@threads
- Implement task-based parallelism for better load balancing
- Add SIMD vectorization for particle calculations
- Consider GPU acceleration for large simulations

### 4. Type Stability

- Ensure all functions are type-stable
- Add explicit type annotations where necessary
- Use @inbounds for array access when safe
- Use @fastmath where appropriate for physics calculations

### 5. Data Structure Improvements

- Optimize KDTree structure for better cache locality
- Consider Space-Filling Curves (Z-order, Hilbert) for improved spatial locality
- Store particles in structure-of-arrays format rather than array-of-structures
- Use more efficient data representations for particles and tree nodes

## Implementation Plan

1. **Profile the existing code** using Julia's built-in profiler to identify hotspots
2. **Establish benchmarks** with smaller datasets for rapid testing
3. **Implement optimizations incrementally** in order of expected impact:
   - StaticArrays for particle positions and velocities
   - Improved memory management and pre-allocation
   - Algorithm improvements
   - Parallelization optimizations
4. **Verify correctness** after each optimization
5. **Measure performance improvements** after each major change

## Expected Outcomes

- 3-5x performance improvement for single-threaded execution
- Better scaling with thread count (closer to linear)
- Reduced memory pressure and GC overhead
- Ability to handle larger particle counts efficiently
